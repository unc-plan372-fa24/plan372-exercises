# These are all negative. However, the definition of an eigenvector for an nxn matrix
# is a vector (in the geometric sense) in n-dimensional space that changes only by a constant
# when linearly transformed by the transformation defined by treating the adjacency matrix as
# a transformation matrix. Scaling the length of that vector does not change the transformation
# it undergoes. So eigenvectors can be normalized in any arbitrary way. igraph normalizes the
# eigenvectors to have the largest value be 1, whereas R normalizes them to have length 1. We can
# divide our manual eigenvector by the igraph eigenvector and see that it's a constant multiple.
# from the R eigen documentation:
# The vectors are normalized to unit length.

# Recall that the eigenvectors are only defined up to a constant: even when the length is
# specified they are still only defined up to a scalar of modulus one (the sign for real matrices).
