Purpose:

The purpose of the ES Program is to improve the system of sharing information for suspected child abuse cases by establishing an electronic Suspected Child Abuse Report (SCAR) system that will be used by district attorney offices, local law enforcement, and county child welfare services departments.

Description:

For many years, the Suspected Child Abuse Report (SCAR) has been shared by county agencies primarily by fax, which has become technologically outdated. This method of sharing critical information is insufficient for timely and reliable communication.

In 2005, Los Angeles County identified the need for an electronic Suspected Child Abuse Report System (eSCARS) and developed a secure web-based database that is used by the Los Angeles County Department of Child and Family Services, the district attorney’s office, and local law enforcement agencies.

In fiscal year 2016-17, the Cal OES Victim Services Branch released an RFP to fund three additional counties with CJA funds to develop and implement eSCARS. Santa Barbara County, Yolo County, and Fresno County were awarded funds and are currently finalizing their eSCARS development.

Through interviews with Santa Barbara County, Yolo County, Fresno County, and Los Angeles County, the eSCARS Guidance Document (Attachment A) was developed by NPC Research. The Guidance Document provides detailed steps for developing an eSCARS. This document must be used by the counties selected for funding.

The purpose of the ES Program is to improve the system of sharing information for suspected child abuse cases by establishing an electronic SCAR system that will be used by district attorney offices, local law enforcement agencies, and child welfare services departments.

"Family Homelessness Challenge Grant, Round 1",https://www.grants.ca.gov/grants/family-homelessness-challenge-grant-round-1/,"CA Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency",Dependent,"Details
Purpose:

Cal ICH will fund innovative applications that accelerate efforts by local jurisdictions and continuums of care to address and end family homelessness by making families’ experiences of homelessness rare, brief, and one-time.

Applicants shall present an innovative proposal that includes a self-identified prioritized objective that complements, augments, or strengthens a community’s efforts to address and end family homelessness.

 

Description:

BackgroundThe California Interagency Council on Homelessness (Cal ICH) was created in 2017 to oversee the implementation of Housing First policies, guidelines, and regulations to reduce the prevalence and duration of homelessness in California. The Council's mission is to develop policies and to identify and coordinate resources, benefits, and services to prevent and work toward ending homelessness in California.Eligible Applicants• Local Jurisdiction – means a city, including a charter city, a county, including a charter county, or a city and county, including a charter city and county.• Continuum of Care – as defined in Section 578.3 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

Eligible Population to Serve• FHC-1 funds may only be used for proposals serving family households with dependent minors that are experiencing homelessness.o Family households with dependent minors may include but is not limited to pregnant parents, parenting youth, households engaged in reunification and/or child welfare services.o Homeless is defined in Section 578.3 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as that section read on May 1, 2018.Available Funds for This Round $30 million will be distributed across a minimum of two rounds of funding. This RFA is for Round 1 of funds totaling $15 million (FHC-1). Awards for FHC-1 will be determined through this competitive RFA process.Subsequent Rounds of Funding Grantees that are awarded Round 1 funds, remain in compliance with FHC-1 requirements and demonstrate reasonable, sufficient progress toward their self-identified, prioritized objective may apply for the second round of grant funding (FHC-2). Only FHC-1 grantees are eligible to compete for FHC-2.

Shared Objective of These Funds

1. FHC-1 Objective Cal ICH will fund innovative applications that accelerate efforts by local jurisdictions and continuums of care to address and end family homelessness by making families’ experiences of homelessness rare, brief, and one-time.• Rare: Prevented whenever possible• Brief: Ended quickly whenever it does occur through a focus on Housing First approaches and housing outcomes

• One-time: Ended successfully the first time

An innovative proposal complements, augments, or strengthens a community’s efforts to address and end family homelessness. Innovative is relative to a community’s existing efforts (if any); it does not necessarily mean a paradigm shift. For example, to reduce the length of time a household remains homeless and lessen potential returns to homelessness, a community may seek to augment existing housing navigation efforts specifically for family households with dependent minors. 2. Self-Identified, Prioritized ObjectiveApplicants shall present an innovative proposal that includes a self-identified prioritized objective that aligns with the FHC-1 objective (i.e., rare, brief, and / or one-time). For example, one proposal may focus on making an impact on “rare” and “brief” whereas another proposal focuses primarily on “one-time.” Proposals will be scored on the likelihood of making a strong impact upon their self-identified, prioritized objective.

The Budget Act of 2021 (SB 170, Chapter 240) appropriated $32 million from the California State Budget to CDFA for methane emissions reductions from dairy and livestock operations. CDFA will make approximately $18.2 million (60% of $30.4 million) available for the DDRDP. The Alternative Manure Management Program
(AMMP) will receive approximately $12.2 million (40% of $30.4 million) to support non-digester practices that reduce methane from dairy and livestock operations, which includes an allocation for technical assistance grants under AB 2377.

CDFA will fund up to 50% of the total project cost with a maximum grant award of $1.6 million per project. Therefore, a minimum of 50% matching funds is required (no more than 25% in-kind contributions). The maximum project term is two (2) years. Grant funds cannot be expended before January 1, 2023, or after December 31, 2024. CDFA may offer an award different than the amount requested. 

The project site must be located on a commercial California dairy operation. Individuals and/or entities receiving grant award funds must be located in California with a physical California business address. A dairy operation is defined as an entity that operates a dairy herd, which produces milk or cream commercially, and whose bulk milk or bulk cream is received or handled by any distributor, manufacturer, or any nonprofit cooperative association of dairy producers. Existing milk producers, including Federal and California Recognized Native American Indian Tribes, and dairy digester developers are eligible for this program.

2022 ALTERNATIVE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM,https://www.grants.ca.gov/grants/2022-alternative-manure-management-program/,CA Department of Food and Agriculture,Dependent,"Details
Purpose:

The California Department of Food and Agriculture's (CDFA) Alternative Manure Management Program (AMMP) awards competitive grants to California dairy and livestock operations for technologies and specific management practices that result in long-term methane emission reductions and maximize environmental benefits.

Description:

The Budget Act of 2021 (SB 170, Chapter 240) appropriated $32 million from the California State Budget to CDFA for methane emissions reductions from dairy and livestock operations. CDFA will make approximately $12.2 million (40% of $30.4 million) available for the AMMP, which includes an allocation for technical assistance grants under AB 2377. The Dairy Digester Research and Development Program (DDRDP) will have approximately $18.2 million available to support digesters that reduce methane emissions from dairy operations.

CDFA will fund up to 100% of the total project cost with a maximum grant award of $750,000 per project. Matching funds are strongly encouraged. The maximum project term is two (2) years. Grant funds cannot be expended before January 1, 2023, or after December 31, 2024. CDFA may offer an award different than the amount requested.

The project site must be located on a commercial California dairy or livestock operation. Individuals receiving grant award funds must be located in California with a physical California business address. A dairy operation is defined as an entity that operates a dairy herd, which produces milk or cream commercially, and whose bulk milk or bulk cream is received or handled by any distributor, manufacturer, or any nonprofit cooperative association of dairy producers. A livestock operation is defined as an entity raising farm animals such ascattle, poultry, goats, sheep, swine, and horses. AMMP supports several project types for which there are methods to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. To be eligible, the current baselinemanure management practices must include the anaerobic decomposition of volatile solids stored in a lagoon or other predominantly liquid anaerobic environment. Methane is produced when volatile manure solids are stored in wet, anaerobic conditions; consequently, conditions that lead to methane production must currently exist at a dairy or livestock operation in order for methane emission reductions to be achieved through an AMMP project.

While solid separation or conversion from flush to dry scrape manure collection can be a critical component of an AMMP project, these practices are not considered to be stand-alone projects because they relate only to how manure is separated or collected. In order to calculate GHG emissions and emission reductions, it is also necessary to identify how the separated or collected manure volatile solids will be treated and/or stored (e.g., open solar drying, composting in vessel). Storage or further treatment will always take place with separated orcollected solids, and applicants are required to identify what this will be. The storage or further treatment of the collected solids produces methane to varying degrees, as determined by the Methane Conversion Factor (MCF) for each practice. Applicants should use the definitions provided to determine which practice most closely describes how they will manage separated or scraped manure volatile solids.

The program supports libraries in serving the career, educational, and personal needs of approximately 17% of California adults without a high school diploma.

Description:

The funding opportunity offers public libraries the chance to offer Career Online High School, an online diploma program for adults age 19 and up. Approximately 17% of California's adults do not have a high school diploma. Public library jurisdictions in the state may apply to join the program.

Each new applicant library must fill out an online application, indicating local need, institutional capacity to support the program, availability of matching funds, and director approval. Applications from libraries are reviewed four times a year: March 10, June 10, September 10, and December 10. New applicants generally receive a minimum of six seats in the program (known as scholarships): three provided at no cost to the library, and three ($1,095 each) supported by the local jurisdiction. Applicants may apply to waive the full matching requirement but must support at least one scholarship with local funds. Successful applicant libraries may then award scholarships to adults who hold library cards in that system. Scholarships are awarded by a library only after an adult successfully completes a self-assessment, prerequisite course, interview, and trial period.

Libraries currently offering Career Online High School may apply for additional scholarships, using a different online application. These applications are reviewed four times a year: March 10, June 10, September 10, and December 10. The same matching formula applies (minimum of three State-supported scholarships for each three locally supported scholarships, with an opportunity to apply for a waiver of the full match). Typical award amounts range from three to over a hundred no-cost scholarships. Typically, up to 20 awards are made each year. An archived webinar and staff provide support to applicants. There are no planning grants. Keywords: secondary education, adult education, library, diploma, career training.

2021 Emergency Solutions Grant Program (ESG),https://www.grants.ca.gov/grants/2021-emergency-solutions-grant-program-esg/,Department of Housing and Community Development,Dependent,"Details
Purpose:

See Standard Agreement

Description:

ESG funds may be used for four primary activities: Street Outreach, Rapid Re-Housing Assistance, Emergency Shelter, and Homelessness Prevention. In addition, ESG funds may be used for associated Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) costs and administrative activities for some subrecipients.

The ESG program provides funding for the following objectives: • Engaging individuals and families experiencing homelessness. • Improving the quality of Emergency Shelters (ES) for individuals and families experiencing homelessness by helping to operate these shelters, and by providing essential services to shelter residents;• Rapidly re-housing individuals and families experiencing homelessness; and• Preventing families/individuals from becoming homeless. The funds are distributed in two separate funding pools: the CoC allocation and the Balance of State (BoS) allocation. Funding in the BoS allocation is made available based on recommendations from a CoC in two ways:

1. Through regional competitions within three geographic regions (Northern Region, Bay Area Region, Central and Imperial Valley Region) pursuant to California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 25 CCR 8404 (a) (3); and

2. Through a noncompetitive process for Rapid Re-Housing (RR) activities.

Continuum of Care Allocation:CoCs within this allocation have at least one city or county that receives ESG funds directly from HUD. Within the CoC Allocation, Administrative Entities (AEs) are selected by the Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) to administer an allocation of funds provided through a formula for their service area. These AEs must be local governments of ESG Entitlement Areas and must commit to administering ESG funds in collaboration with their CoC throughout their CoC Service Area, including ensuring access to ESG funds by households living in Nonentitlement Areas. A minimum of 40 percent of each AE Allocation must be used for Rapid Rehousing activities.

Eligible Applicants and Eligible Areas to Be Served:The Department subgrants its funding to subrecipients in Continuum of Care (CoC) service areas that have at least one jurisdiction that does not receive ESG funds directly from HUD (“Nonentitlement”). In the CoC Allocation, local governmental entities are eligible subrecipients, who in turn select homeless service providers to receive the funds. In the Balance of State Allocation, private nonprofit organizations or units of general purpose local government are eligible subrecipients that receive ESG funds directly from the Department.

State ESG funded activities may serve the entire service area of the CoC, but must serve Nonentitlement areas within the service area. For a list of CoC Service Areas eligible to participate in the State’s ESG program, refer to Appendix A of the current NOFA.

The Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience Program (SAFER),https://www.grants.ca.gov/grants/the-safe-and-affordable-funding-for-equity-and-resilience-program-safer/,State Water Resources Control Board,Dependent,"Details
Purpose:

The Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience Program (SAFER) is a set of tools, funding sources, and regulatory authorities designed to ensure that one million Californians who currently lack safe drinking water receive safe & affordable drinking water as quickly as possible. The SAFER Program’s goal is to provide safe drinking water in every California community, for every Californian.

Description:

In 2019, Senate Bill 200 (SB200) established the Safe and Affordable Drinking Water (SADW) Fund to address funding gaps and provide solutions to water systems, especially those serving DACs, to address both their short- and long-term drinking water needs. The SADW Fund is one of several funds that are part of the larger SAFER Program. 

Complementary funding sources administered by the State Water Board’s Division of Financial Assistance for drinking water projects include: General Fund allocations, the Cleanup and Abatement Account, Proposition 68 Drinking Water, Proposition 1 and Proposition 68 Groundwater, and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF), which offers repayable, low-interest financing and loans with partial or complete principal forgiveness.

Up to $130 million per year will be available from the SADW Fund for ten years (starting with Fiscal Year 2020-21) for local assistance and state operations. The amount available from complementary funding sources varies each year. 

The priority uses of the SADW Fund include: 1) addressing any emergency or urgent funding needs, where other emergency funds are not available and a critical water shortage or outage could occur without support from the Fund; 2) addressing community water systems (CWSs) and school water systems out of compliance with primary health standards, focusing on small Disadvantaged Communities (DACs); 3) accelerating consolidations for systems out of compliance, at-risk systems, as well as state smalls and domestic wells, focusing on small DACs; 4) providing interim solutions and initiating planning efforts for long-term solutions for state smalls and domestic wells with source water above a primary maximum contaminant level (MCL). Anticipated expenditures of the SADW Fund will be consistent with the priorities and will be used in conjunction with other available complementary funding available in the larger SAFER Program to address funding gaps. Priorities for the complementary funding sources part of the larger SAFER Program generally align with the priorities of the SADW Fund. 

Eligible recipients of funding from the SADW Fund include public agencies, nonprofit organizations, public utilities, mutual water companies, California Native American Tribes, administrators, and groundwater sustainability agencies. Funding provided to a public utility that is regulated by the Public Utilities Commission or a mutual water company must have a clear and definite public purpose and benefit the customers of the water systems and not the investors or shareholders.
