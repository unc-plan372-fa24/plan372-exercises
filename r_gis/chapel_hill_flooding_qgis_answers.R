# it's probably a good idea to go back to QGIS to see if these are simply duplicates,
# or something else.

# it looks like these aren't duplicates, but parcels that are split into multiple pieces e.g. by a road
# The permits dataset, though, has records for the entire parcel. We'll get an incorrect
# answer if we use this, because we'll be essentially duplicating the development that occurred
# for each part of a parcel. So we should group the parcels and sum up the areas, but not sum
# up the development costs, so we have one row per parcel that accurately reflects development
parcels = group_by(data, PIN) |>

    floodarea=any(floodarea==1)
  )


# use the filter function to remove non-Chapel Hill parcels by filtering
# for non-NA construction cost. In this case, the parcel_permits data file contained
# records for all of Chapel Hill, even if parcels didn't have any permits pulled, and
# just had a zero for the constrction cost.

# If you were doing a similar analysis, you'd want to check this - you wouldn't
# want to accidentally exclude parcels that hadn't had any permits pulled.
parcels = filter(parcels, !is.na(parcel_permits_total_construction_cost))

# now, use group_by and summarize to compute development intensity inside and
# outside the flood zone. Think about whether you are computing development intensity
# per square foot, or per square foot per lot

# I am summing up total cost and total area by flood zone / non flood zone, and
# then computing intensity afterwards. If I just took a mean of the already-calculated
# development intensity, I would undercount large parcels, because they would contribute
# the same to the mean as small parcels, whereas in actuality development intensity large parcels 
# represents more development.
